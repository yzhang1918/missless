# AGENTS.md

This document defines the product-specific collaboration overlay for
`missless`.

The generic harness workflow contract is installed and managed below by
`easyharness`. The repository-owned guidance above that managed block should
stay focused on `missless` itself: product truth surfaces, documentation sync
expectations, and repository boundaries.

## Mission

Build `missless` as an agent-first, repository-legible system that turns information overload into decision clarity.

## Non-Negotiable Rules

1. Repository is the single source of truth for approved plans, specs, validation evidence, and completed execution history.
2. All docs and code must be written in English.
3. Every meaningful change must update docs/specs in the same branch.
4. Evidence over opinion: decisions link to specs, plans, or run artifacts.
5. `missless` keeps product-specific repository guidance here; generic harness workflow behavior belongs to `easyharness`, not a second local process stack.

## Product Source Of Truth

- Product intent and workflow goals: `docs/product-specs/`
- Design rationale and decision history: `docs/design-docs/`
- Technical contracts and durable interface expectations: `docs/specs/`
- Tracked plans and archived execution history: `docs/plans/`
- Repository map and folder responsibilities: `ARCHITECTURE.md`
- Documentation-wide navigation: `docs/index.md`

## Role Split

- Human: set priorities, constraints, acceptance criteria, and final tradeoff calls.
- Codex: execute end-to-end, keep docs/code aligned, surface risks clearly.

## Task Intake Gate

Before any discovery/plan/execution work:
- If the human has not explicitly provided a task, Codex must ask a concise clarification question first.
- Codex must confirm objective and success criteria before entering discovery.
- Codex must not start implementation-oriented work on assumed tasks.

## Start Points

- Repository and current execution state: `README.md` and `harness status`
- Direct synchronous requests: start from the human's explicit chat request, then enter harness discovery when needed
- Product context: `docs/product-specs/index.md`
- Design rationale: `docs/design-docs/index.md`
- Technical contracts: `docs/specs/index.md`
- Product plan history and active tracked plans: `harness status`, then `docs/plans/active/` or `docs/plans/archived/` as needed
- Detailed standards: `docs/standards/repository-standards.md`

## Documentation Sync Expectations

- If product intent, user workflow, or feature positioning changes, update the
  affected file under `docs/product-specs/`.
- If an implementation decision changes technical behavior, interface shape, or
  data contracts, update the affected file under `docs/specs/`.
- If a change introduces or reverses an important tradeoff, record that
  rationale under `docs/design-docs/`.
- If a change alters top-level repository boundaries or document ownership,
  update `ARCHITECTURE.md`.
- When folder contents or entry docs change, update the relevant `index.md` in
  the same branch.

## Repository-Local Skills

Repository-local skills live under `.agents/skills/`.
For `missless`, the active workflow skills are the `easyharness`-managed
`harness-*` skills plus any narrow repository helpers that are still useful.
Do not reintroduce a second repo-local copy of generic harness workflow rules.

## Git Rules

- Main branch: `main`
- Working branch prefix: `codex/`
- Commits: small and atomic
- Commit cadence: commits can happen multiple times during execution;
  publish/merge timing is controlled by the active harness workflow, not by the
  `commit` skill itself.
- Never rewrite shared history without explicit approval

## Harness Working Agreement

1. Humans steer. Agents execute.
2. Approved scope lives in a git-tracked plan.
3. Raw execution trajectory lives in `.local/` and is disposable.
4. Durable summaries, contracts, and behavior changes must be written back to
   tracked docs or code before archive.
5. Evidence beats memory. Use `harness status`, tracked plans, and owned local
   artifacts instead of relying on long-session recall.
6. Keep tracked docs and code in English.

## Harness Source of Truth

The default harness split in this repository is:

- tracked plan in `docs/plans/`: markdown-led plan packages, durable step
  closeout, archive-ready summaries, and any matching `supplements/`
  companion directories
- `.local/harness/plans/archived/`: archived lightweight plan snapshots
- `.local/harness/`: disposable runtime state, review artifacts, evidence artifacts, and trajectory
- `docs/specs/`: normative harness contracts
- `.agents/skills`: repo-local harness workflow skills

If a tracked plan conflicts with a repo-local skill, the tracked plan wins.

## Harness Workflow

For medium or large work:

1. Discovery
2. Plan
3. Plan approval
4. Execute
4. Archive / publish / await merge approval
5. Land

Plan approval is explicit. Writing a plan or hearing the original task request
does not by itself approve execution. After the plan is shown and the human
approves it, the agent should record that boundary with
`harness plan approve --by human` before `harness execute start`.

For approved low-risk work that explicitly uses `workflow_profile:
lightweight`, keep the same workflow shape but store the active plan under
`docs/plans/active/` like any other plan. Only the archived lightweight
snapshot moves to `.local/harness/plans/archived/<plan-stem>.md`. That
shortcut does not remove human steering, low-risk eligibility checks, or the
requirement to leave a repo-visible breadcrumb such as a PR body note.

Use `lightweight` only when all of these are true:

- the human explicitly approves using `workflow_profile: lightweight`
- the plan is sized `XXS`
- the whole slice is one bounded low-risk change
- the edits stay within a narrow surface such as README/docs/comments/copy, a
  small CI condition adjustment, a tiny helper-script fix, or another similarly
  small change whose blast radius is easy to explain
- no schema-meaning changes, core state/review/archive/evidence changes,
  release-safety changes, or security-sensitive logic changes
- if the boundary is unclear, default to `standard`

`size` and `workflow_profile` are separate decisions. `XXS` is the only size
eligible for `lightweight`, and `XXS` may still use the ordinary `standard`
workflow when that is the approved path.

When drafting a new plan, estimate `size` early. If the initial estimate is
`XXL`, stop and confirm with the human whether the work should be split first;
if the split is unclear, return to discovery to settle a better split before
execution approval. If the work still proceeds as `XXL`, move obvious spillover
into `Deferred Items` or follow-up issues instead of letting the oversized plan
quietly absorb extra scope. `XXL` remains available for truthful historical
sizing and rare coherent large slices, but it should not be the routine
starting point for new work.

Use `harness reopen --mode finalize-fix|new-step` when an archived candidate
is no longer merge-ready because of new feedback, remote changes, or other
invalidation.

## Harness Subagent Use

The controller owns shared repository context and the final workflow judgment.
Spawn subagents only for bounded subproblems; do not split one shared context
bundle across multiple subagents just to get summaries back.

Discovery and execution may stay local, use one subagent, or use multiple
subagents in parallel according to the current question shape:

- stay local when the controller can answer the next question from the shared
  context it already needs to hold
- use `1` when one bounded question or hypothesis needs independent repo
  checking
- use multiple subagents in parallel only when multiple hypotheses or
  questions are genuinely independent

In Codex, spawned subagents are not fire-and-forget memory. Once a bounded
subagent task is complete and the controller has received the result, close
that subagent promptly by default. Reuse `resume_agent` only when a later
narrow follow-up makes continuity materially more valuable than a fresh agent.

## Harness Review Execution

When work enters review orchestration, spawned reviewer subagents are the
default path. The controller agent stays in `harness-execute`, reviewer work
belongs to spawned `harness-reviewer` subagents, and the repo-local review
skills must be followed strictly. The shared rules in `Harness Subagent Use`
still apply here; review-specific docs add reviewer-slot orchestration,
aggregation, and same-slot resume rules on top of that shared baseline.

The controller must not submit reviewer results on a reviewer's behalf. Each
reviewer submission should be recorded through
`harness review submit --by <reviewer-name>`
from the bounded reviewer thread that owns that slot.

Routine review progression is controller-owned once a tracked plan is approved.
The controller should not stop to ask the human whether ordinary step-closeout
or finalize review should begin.

For `delta` review, use a real git commit anchor so later agents know the
default starting point for the reviewed change.

Use `harness status` at routine checkpoints:

- when starting or resuming execution
- before marking a step done
- after each review aggregate
- before relying on later-step or finalize progression after a warning or fix

Human confirmation is still required for real blockers, scope changes, and
merge approval, but not for ordinary review closeout.

If an approved plan is likely to require reviewer subagents later, ask for
explicit human authorization when seeking plan approval instead of waiting
until review orchestration is already blocked on that permission.

## Harness Start Points

When entering the repository or resuming after compaction:

1. Read `README.md` if you need repository purpose or setup context.
2. Run `harness status`.
3. If `harness status` reports a current plan artifact, open that plan.
   Active work always uses a tracked plan under `docs/plans/active/`; archived
   lightweight candidates may live under `.local/harness/plans/archived/`.
   If status reports `idle`, there is no current plan to resume yet.
4. Most resumed work should continue in `harness-execute`.
5. Switch only when `harness status` and the workflow boundary clearly call for
   a different skill:
   - `harness-discovery` when direction is unclear
   - `harness-plan` when creating or revising a tracked plan
   - `harness-land` only when `state.current_node` is
     `execution/finalize/await_merge` and a human has explicitly approved
     merge
   - `harness-reviewer` only inside spawned reviewer subagents
